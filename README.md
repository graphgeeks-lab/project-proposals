## Graph Geeks Open Source Project Proposal

Welcome to the Graph Geeks Open Source Project Proposal! This repository serves as a platform for collaborative project selection and planning within our community. Our goal is to foster transparency, inclusivity, and community ownership by conducting our project selection and planning processes in an open and participatory manner.

### Objectives:

1. **Transparency:** By conducting our project selection and planning processes in an open repository, we aim to promote transparency and visibility into our community's activities. This allows all members to stay informed about ongoing projects and contribute to discussions and decision-making.

2. **Community Engagement:** We believe that by involving our community members in the project selection and planning process, we can create a more engaged and supportive community. Through contributions, suggestions, and discussions, we aim to harness the collective expertise and creativity of our community to identify and prioritize projects that align with our goals and interests.

3. **Ownership and Accountability:** By encouraging everyone to take ownership of the project selection and planning process, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and accountability within our community. This empowers individuals to actively contribute to the development and success of projects, leading to greater satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.

### How to Participate:

1. **Project Proposal Templates:** We will be providing templates for project proposals to streamline the submission process. These templates will include sections for project description, objectives, deliverables, time allocation, and estimated hours. Community members are encouraged to use these templates when submitting project proposals.

2. **Contribution Guidelines:** We welcome contributions and suggestions from all community members. Whether you have an idea for a new project or would like to provide feedback on existing proposals, you can do so by creating a pull request or opening an issue in this repository. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to our contribution guidelines to maintain consistency and clarity.

3. **Time Allocation and Hours Estimate:** In order to effectively plan and prioritize projects, we request that project proposals include a time allocation and estimated hours for each task or milestone. This information will help us better understand the scope and resource requirements of each project and make informed decisions about project prioritization and resource allocation.

### Get Involved:

We invite all members of the Graph Geeks community to participate in this open source project proposal process. Whether you are a seasoned contributor or new to open source, your contributions and feedback are valuable in shaping the future of our community projects.

Together, let's build a supportive and collaborative community where everyone has a voice and takes ownership of our collective success.
